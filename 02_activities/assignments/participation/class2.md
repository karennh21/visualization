## Activity: Comment our code
### What information is it helpful to include?
It is important to include information about what the code does, functions being used, and explain any design decisions that were made. 

### How do you write a ‘goodʼ comment?
Comments should not be a duplication of the code but they should explain the function/purpose of the code. 
Make the comments concise and easy to read for people who may not be experienced coders. 
Provide links to original sources of copied code and include links to external references. 

## Activity: Visualization #1: US Gun Killings in 2018
### What information can we learn from this visualization?
We can learn the number of people killed in the US from gun violence and the estimated number of years stolen. It provides emphasis on the distribution of the race, gender, age group, location, gun type, victim count and assailant that caused the deaths. 
From the visualization, it shows that a high amount of victims were part of a young age group, were male, and black americans were dispropotionately killed. 

### Is this an example of objective, neutral data visualization? Why or why not?
No, this is not an example of objective, neutral data visualization because it provides it illicits an emotional response. The data is not represented in a typical graph. The data visualization has distinct colours, different plot points, and different colours and sizes for the font which makes the data stand out. 

## Activity: Visualization #2: Washington Post Active Shooters
### What information can we learn from this visualization?

The number of shootings mostly increases every year, so there is an upward trend. 

### Is this an example of objective, neutral data visualization? Why or why not?
It can be argued that it is an objective, neutral data visualization example because the design is a standard and plain histogram. It is only looking at two variables and does not show any other factors affecting the number of active shootings. The design is more neutral and does not illicit an emotional response compared to the first visualization. That way the viewer can interpret the results in their own way. 

## Acitivty: 
### Does your choice in data visualization succeed in the qualities of data visualization: aesthetic, substantive, and perceptual?

I think the data visualization I choose was aesthetic because the density plot is a two-dimensional image, it has a clean layout, there are geometric lines/shapes, and includes the variables are easily identifiable. 
The data visualization could be substantive because the scales are consistent and are not manipulated which could cause a different interpretation.  
The data visualization is not perceptual because it does not indicate what the two different colours represent or what they are comparing within the graph.
